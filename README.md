# Snakemake workflow: ASTRA
[![Snakemake](https://img.shields.io/badge/snakemake-â‰¥8.10.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://snakemake.bitbucket.io)

ASTRA (Advanced Snakemake Pipeline for Thorough Variant Analysis) performs 
Variant Calling (with [DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant)) and 
Variant Annotation (with [VEP](https://grch37.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html))
starting from tumor BAM files.
ASTRA is part of the Snakemake-based pipelines collection [solida-core](https://github.com/solida-core) 
developed and manteined at [CRS4](https://www.crs4.it).

## Usage

The usage of this workflow is described in the 
[Snakemake Workflow Catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog?usage=solida-core/diva).

If you use this workflow in a paper, 
don't forget to give credits to the authors by citing the URL of this (original) repository and its DOI (see above).

## INSTRUCTIONS
Create a virtual environment with the command:
```commandline
mamba create -c bioconda -c conda-forge --name snakemake snakemake=8.10 snakedeploy
```
and activate it:
```commandline
conda activate snakemake
```

We get some public data to test the pipeline. You can directly clone in this folder from github, just type:
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/solida-core/test-data-DNA.git
```
You can then perform the pipeline deploy defining a directory `my_work_dir` for analysis output and a pipeline tag for a specific version:
```bash
snakedeploy deploy-workflow https://github.com/solida-core/astra 
                    /path/to/my_work_dir 
                    --tag XXXX
```
To run the pipeline, go inside the deployed pipeline folder and use the command:
```bash
snakemake --use-conda -p --cores all
```
You can generate analysis report with the command:
```bash
snakemake --report report.zip --cores all
```
